Final project for CSCI-450, Principles of Software Engineering. Over the course of a month we created a self contained budgeting app with close attention to design paradigms like the waterfall method, use case diagrams, and use of automated testing software.

To run this application on your local machine, you must install node package module (npm). Use the this [link](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to download/install. 

Make sure you have npm by typing the following into the command line:
```
npm
```

You will not get an error message if npm is installed.

Next, run the following command in the budgetPlannerV2 directory of the application.
```
npm init
```

Next, run the following command:
```
npm install dependencies
```

To run the app on your local computer, use the following command:
```
node app.js
```

Next go to a browser of your choosing, and enter the following URL: http://localhost:3000/

Happy budget planning!
